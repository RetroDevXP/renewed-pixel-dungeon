Enemies
----------

Added new enemy: Dwarven Warrior, encountered in the Dwarven Metropolis.

Golems deal more damage but are slower, allowing you to run from them.

Bats actually have slightly more accuracy at night (midnight - 7 a.m.) though this won't have much of an effect on the difficulty.

Slightly modified Goo's effect when it affects you with its ooze.

Goo's Pumped up attack is slightly weakened.

DM-300 has a limit when healing itself.

DM-300 takes slight damage from ice, more damage from fire.

Scorpio's serrated spikes are sometimes dropped to be usable as a thrown weapon.

Gnoll Scouts also spawn all the way to Caves. More of a lore reason than a balance reason. They are, however, not common after the sewers.

Gnoll Shamans drop scrolls more often.

Bats drop potions of healing slightly more often, not game-changing though.

Sewer Crabs, Spinners, and Scorpio drops food more often.

...and other balance changes, such as stats of some enemies. In general, late-game is slightly less difficult.

Hunger
----------

It takes much longer to starve. By extension, each food also keeps you satiated for longer.

However, the penalty for starving is much more severe. Instead of losing 1 health, you lose health based on a percentage of your remaining HP. You also deal significantly less damage when starving.

Buffs
----------
Blindness also decreases accuracy of attacks.

Added new buff: Thrill of the hunt, exclusive to the Chaser subclass.
